# PDF Vulnerability Scanner
Even today, phishing remains one of the most common and effective cyber attacks. 
Phishing attacks are everywhere, and their targets vary dynamically. 
One can use a phishing attack to simply gather information about various users fake a personality, steal credit card information or simply spam and harass them.
contrary to these "simple" attacks phishing can be used to gain administrative access to big corporation networks, which will cause serious harm in well-known and respected companies.
One of the most common phishing techniques is phishing with PDF files. The popular and widely-used file format is being transferred just about everywhere.
An attacker can create a PDF file with malicous code injected into it, and thus let a malware transfer throughtout the networking system of the target.
This means, once the file reaches to right computer, the attacker can escalate privileges, gain root access and run code and administrator commands on the vulnerable server.
This is a problem we intende to solve with PDF Vulnerability Scanner. We'll first open the file with our special system, check for any known vulnerabilities and report it to the user.
After the PDF is scanned, and in case no malicious intent was found it will be opened normally with your default PDF app.
